/***Update the header**: the text is a little wonky being aligned on the left
  like that. Provide a property that aligns it in the center instead.

- **Center our image**: We only have one image on the page and we would like it
  centered!

- **Jazz up our navigation links**: Let's center all of our nav links as well.
  Give all of the `<a>` tags within our navbar padding of 10px on their left and
  right sides. In addition, change their background color to something of your
  choosing. We chose grey!

- **Our image caption needs work**: Let's shrink that font size down and make
  sure it is centered.

- **Update the text block**: Wouldn't it look nicer if our text was centered as
  well? Our image is about 900px wide, so let's give all our `<p>`s within
  `#featured-property` a hard width of 800px and center the text in there. Be
  sure to keep a little vertical space around the `<p>`s.

- **Make our `#details` section horizontal**: The details section could go
  nicely as a footer to the page, instead of a vertical list. To do this, make
  each of the `<div>`s `float` to the `left`.

- **As a finishing touch**: Let's clean up the `<div>`s at the bottom of the
  page. All of them should have the same background color, centered text, and
  occupy 25% of the `width` of the bottom row (since we have 4 divs).
